      <p className="text-gray-300 mb-6 text-lg">
        At Earn4Edu, we're committed to helping low-income students learn, earn, and pursue their dreams while maintaining focus on their education. Through our program, students work â‰¤15 hours per week, ensuring their studies remain the top priority.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-300 mb-12 text-lg">
        We believe that no student should have to abandon their education due to financial constraints. Our initiative supports students in learning valuable skills and earning part-time income while continuing their studies, enabling them to support their families without compromising their future.
